# 🐍Python-Project-1
# Project Title: Simple Calculator using Python Programming Language 
# 📋Overview:

The Simple Calculator project is a basic Python application designed to perform fundamental arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It provides an easy-to-use interface for users to input two numbers and select the desired operation, displaying the result instantly.

# 📌Objective:

The main goal of this project is to understand and implement the basic concepts of Python programming, including user input, conditional statements, and functions. It also helps in building problem-solving skills by applying programming logic to perform mathematical operations.

# 💡Features:

## Performs basic arithmetic operations:
➤ Addition   

➤ Subtraction   

➤ Multiplication   

➤ Division   

➤ Average 

Error handling for invalid inputs (like division by zero).

Simple and user-friendly design.

# 🛠️Technologies Used:

**Programming Language:-** Python Programming Language  

**Tools:-** Visual Studio Code(VS Code)

# ⚙️Working Principle:

The calculator takes two numerical inputs from the user and asks for the operation to be performed. Using conditional statements (if-elif-else), the program processes the operation and displays the result. The use of functions makes the code modular and easier to maintain.I have created a Simple Calculator Project using the Python programming language. This calculator is designed to perform five basic arithmetic operations — addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and average. The project takes input from the user, processes the selected operation, and displays the result in a clear and simple format. It helps in understanding the use of variables, user input, conditional statements, and basic logic building in Python. The tool used for developing this project is Visual Studio Code (VS Code), which provides an efficient and user-friendly environment for writing and executing Python programs. This project demonstrates how Python can be used to build simple yet functional applications and serves as a foundation for learning more advanced programming concepts in the future.

# 🎯Conclusion:

This project demonstrates the power and simplicity of Python for beginners. It serves as a foundation for developing more advanced applications such as GUI-based or scientific calculators in the future.
